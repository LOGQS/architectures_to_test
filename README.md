## What is this repo about?

This repo contains Python implementations and notes of various Machine Learning architecture/training/... ideas I come across from different sources - papers, talks, conversations, books, online content, you name it. 

These are experimental ideas in the hypothesis stage. Some might work, others might be completely useless or obvious. The point is to implement and document them before potentially testing them properly.

## Implementation

Most implementations are in Python using PyTorch. Code quality and documentation vary depending on how quickly I wanted to get the idea down.

## Status

I have ~113 older architecture ideas/implementations from the past 8 months that I'll gradually add when I have time. For now, I'm focusing on implementing newer ideas as they come up.

## Structure

Each architecture gets its own folder with implementation and basic notes about the idea and its source. Some might have more, some might have less depending on how much they interested me.

                        Stateful Sparse Processing
                    </div>
                    <p>TCT combines selective activation with persistent memory in a specific way: each processing unit maintains its own evolving state, and only the most relevant units participate in each computation. The key difference is that inactive units don't just sit idle—they retain their accumulated knowledge and can be reactivated later with their previous insights intact.</p>
                    
                    <p>This addresses the challenge of maintaining long-term context in sparse systems. When a column becomes active again after being dormant, it can leverage insights gained from previous activations, enabling a form of temporal reasoning that persists across many processing steps.</p>

                    <p>The architecture incorporates a key insight from neuroscience: intelligence emerges from binding "what" information (the features) with "where" information (the context or location). Just as your brain learns about objects by exploring them—tracking both what you feel and where your hand is positioned—each column learns by associating inputs with their contextual positions in the problem space.</p>
                    
                    <p>This principle extends beyond physical movement to abstract cognitive navigation. When processing language or reasoning through problems, columns track both the content and their position in the conceptual landscape, enabling more structured and transferable learning.</p>

                    <p>TCT's persistent column states enable context integration across different positions within a sequence during processing. Each column builds up representations as it processes tokens sequentially, maintaining relevant context from earlier positions to inform processing of later tokens in the same sequence.</p>
                    
                    <p>This can provide richer sequence-level understanding where information from the beginning of a text can influence how the model processes and interprets content toward the end, enabling better capture of dependencies and relationships within individual texts or conversations.</p>

                        Persistent State with Shared Processing
                    </div>
                    <p>TCT addresses a specific challenge: how to maintain thousands of individual persistent memories while keeping computational overhead manageable. Each column needs its own evolving state, but having separate processing logic for each would be prohibitively expensive.</p>
                    
                    <p>The solution combines <span class="highlight">persistent distributed memory</span> (each column maintains its own state) with <span class="highlight">shared computational rules</span> (one processing core serves all columns). This enables rich stateful behavior without the parameter explosion that would come from having unique processing logic for each memory unit.</p>

                        Communication Overhead in Consensus Systems
                    </div>
                    <p>When thousands of processing units need to reach consensus, the communication cost can become prohibitive. TCT addresses this through selective participation—only active columns engage in the consensus process, and they communicate through structured attention mechanisms rather than all-to-all connections.</p>
                    
                    <p>The challenge is maintaining rich inter-column communication while keeping the computational cost manageable as the number of columns scales. The sparse activation and attention-based consensus represent one approach to this fundamental trade-off between communication richness and efficiency.</p>

                        Biological Inspiration: The Neocortical Blueprint
                    </div>
                    <p>The architecture draws inspiration from neuroscience research showing that the entire neocortex follows a remarkably consistent six-layer columnar pattern. Each column acts as a complete modeling system, learning to bind sensory information with location through movement—a process called sensorimotor coupling. Just as your brain tracks your finger's position while exploring a texture, each column maintains its own "reference frame" for understanding its domain.</p>
                    
                    <p>The thousand brains theory suggests that rather than having one centralized model of the world, we have thousands of parallel mini-models that vote and reach consensus. This biological principle directly influenced the design of democratic decision-making in the TCT architecture.</p>

                        Beyond Surface Performance: Internal Representation Quality
                    </div>
                    <p>Recent research reveals a crucial distinction: two models can achieve identical external performance while having completely different internal representations. One might develop clean, modular understanding (unified factored representation), while another creates a messy patchwork of redundant, entangled solutions (fractured entangled representation).</p>
                    
                    <p>The TCT design specifically aims for the first type—encouraging columns to develop reusable, composable knowledge rather than task-specific hacks. This matters because clean internal representations support better generalization, creativity, and learning of new concepts.</p>

                        Long-term Cognitive Evolution
                    </div>
                    <p>TCT explores whether persistent column states can enable genuine long-term cognitive development—the ability to fundamentally change reasoning patterns based on accumulated experience. The architecture provides mechanisms for columns to evolve their processing approaches over extended interactions.</p>
                    
                    <p>This framework investigates whether democratic consensus mechanisms can guide cognitive evolution toward higher-quality internal representations rather than just improved performance metrics. The focus is on developing richer conceptual frameworks that deepen over time.</p>
